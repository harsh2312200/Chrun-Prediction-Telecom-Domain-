## Introduction

Customer churn is a significant issue for telecom companies, as acquiring new customers is often more expensive than retaining existing ones. This project aims to build a predictive model to identify customers who are likely to churn, enabling proactive measures to retain them.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains various features related to customer demographics, account information, and usage patterns. 

## Data Preprocessing

### Missing Value Treatment

Handling missing values is crucial for building an accurate model. We employed different strategies such as mean/median imputation, mode imputation, and forward/backward filling based on the nature of the missing data.

### Feature Engineering

Feature engineering involves creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance. In this project, we:
- Created new features such as customer tenure and average monthly charges.
- Transformed categorical features into numerical representations using techniques like one-hot encoding and label encoding.

### Feature Selection

Feature selection helps in reducing the dimensionality of the dataset, removing irrelevant or redundant features, and improving model performance. We used techniques like:
- Correlation analysis
- Mutual information
- Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)

## Modeling

### Traditional Machine Learning Models

We applied several traditional machine learning algorithms, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

### Deep Learning Model

We developed a deep learning model using a neural network architecture to capture complex patterns in the data. The model consists of multiple layers, including:
- Input layer
- Hidden layers with activation functions
- Output layer with a softmax activation function

### AutoML

We leveraged AutoML frameworks to automate the process of model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and feature engineering. The AutoML frameworks used include:
- H2O.ai
- TPOT (Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool)
- AutoKeras

## Results

The performance of each model was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. The results indicated that [mention the best performing model here] outperformed the other models in terms of predictive accuracy and other relevant metrics.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of various machine learning techniques in predicting customer churn in the telecom domain. By identifying customers at risk of churning, telecom companies can take proactive measures to retain them, thereby reducing customer acquisition costs and improving overall profitability.
